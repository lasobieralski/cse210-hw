# My Finals Project - A Budget Program
This program was inspired by my own need to get a handle on our financial situation. It is tool designed to help me and others how to plan and understand their budgets, expenses, and debts. It creates the big picture so you can see and track how you are doing.

## Key Features:
#### 1. User Identity and Data Loading: recognizes new or returning users and sets up accordingly.
#### 2. Demo Mode: is a playground where a user can navigate and learn how to interact with the program's features without overwriting their real budget.
#### 3. Budget Management: gives you a clear picture of your income and expenses.
#### 4. Debt Tracking: tracks debts in two categories credit cards and loan debts.
#### 5. Report Generation: Paint the overall pictures with totals.
#### 6. Data Persistence: automatically saves a user's work so that they can pick up where they left off and keep moving forward.
## User Experience and Workflow
The program starts by getting a users name for personalization and all to ultimately save any work they key in so upon returning they can pick up where they left off.The program runs a check behind the scene to see if you are a new user or returning user and sets you up accordingly.

While in the demo mode, you can see everything that the program will do along with manipulating the data. It will save whatever you are doing to show you how entries are affected like payments to debts. There is no actual saving that occurs, preserving the integrity of the user's personal records.

## Project Status 
I ran out of time with the many struggles with developing that there are key features like payment history, savings and investment tracking, monthly verses quarterly and yearly reports, etc. that I wasn't able to implement. Before I had to submit my project for grading.
